This repository contains a basic JavaScript implementation of a soccer ball's trajectory when kicked at a specific angle and initial velocity.
## Feature
- Simulates the motion of a soccer ball.
- Considers the influence of gravity and air resistance.
- Provides the position of the ball at various time interval.

## Reminder
JUST A PRIMARY MODEL
Using mathematical way to show the motion of soccer.
